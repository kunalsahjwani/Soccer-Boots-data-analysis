# Soccer-Boots-data-analysis
This project aimed to analyze data on soccer boots worn by football players, collected by scraping websites for information by year. The data was analyzed by creating a dataframe with the pandas library, and exploring the usage of football boots across different age groups and football clubs. Additionally, a word cloud was generated to visualize the popularity of different boots among players, and sentiment analysis was performed by tokenizing the text and assigning sentiment scores to each word using the NLTK and PyTorch libraries.

Regular expressions were used for scraping the data, as they allow for the extraction of specific patterns of text from websites. The re library was used for this purpose, providing functions and methods for working with regular expressions.

For data analysis and manipulation, the pandas library was utilized to create dataframes and perform various data transformations. The creation of the word cloud was achieved using the WordCloud and Matplotlib libraries, which provide functionality for creating visualizations of word frequency.

For sentiment analysis, the NLTK library was used for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stopword removal. The PyTorch library was used to train and apply a sentiment classification model, which assigned sentiment scores to each word in the text.

Overall, this project demonstrated the use of several Python libraries to scrape, analyze, and visualize data on football boots worn by players. The analysis provided insights into usage patterns across different age groups and football clubs, and the visualization of a word cloud allowed for the identification of popular boots among players. The sentiment analysis provided an additional layer of insight, revealing the overall sentiment associated with different boots.

In conclusion, the project showcased the power of using various Python libraries for data scraping, analysis, and visualization. By leveraging these libraries, it is possible to gain valuable insights from web data, which can inform decisions across a range of fields and industries.
